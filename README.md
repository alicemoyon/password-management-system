# password-management-system

The objective of this college project was to create a rudimentary password management system, implemented
using bash scripts.

The main purpose of the password management system is to store the logins and passwords
of different users for different services on a server.

The server has a working directory, within which each user has one main folder
that contains many files (one file per service). Sub-folders can also be included in the user’s
main folder if required in order to organise services into types (for example, a user could
have a sub-folder for ‘Social Media’, which would contain several service files representing
each of the social media services they need login information for.)

Several users are able to create, view, modify or delete services and login/password
information concurrently by using client interfaces that will pass their specific requests to the
server. These requests are executed by the server, and users get the result of the
request on their client interface.
